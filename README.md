# liver-cancer-detection-using-Logistic-Regression



This repository contains code and data for detecting liver cancer using logistic regression. The logistic regression model is a popular statistical technique used for binary classification problems, making it suitable for predicting the probability of liver cancer occurrence.


## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following:

- Python (version 3.0 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for liver cancer detection can be found in the file ``. It contains several features that are potentially relevant for predicting the presence of liver cancer, The data set is images with 2GB size and more 10000 images and organized in normal and tumor images and structured in train and test folder 

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code and dataset files.

2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

3. Ensure that the dataset files is downloaded with the same structure 


Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different algorithms or feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance.
